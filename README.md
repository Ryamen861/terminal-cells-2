This repository contains data and code associated with the paper "The Drosophila tracheal terminal cell as a model for branching morphogenesis" by Tatyana Gavrilchenko, 
Alison G. Simpkins, Tanner Simpson, Lena A. Barrett, Pauline Hansen, Stanislav Y. Shvartsman, and Jodi Schottenfeld-Roames.

# Things to explore:
1. Some branches are growing near the root. As the terminal cell gets bigger, should most of the branching be on the branches further out?
Perhaps the level attribute should somehow give a weight of probability for branching
2. How to implement self-avoidance?
3. Look further into Bnl FGF gradient, Oxygen gradient, filopodia
