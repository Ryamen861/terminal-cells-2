This repository contains data and code associated with the paper "The Drosophila tracheal terminal cell as a model for branching morphogenesis" by Tatyana Gavrilchenko, 
Alison G. Simpkins, Tanner Simpson, Lena A. Barrett, Pauline Hansen, Stanislav Y. Shvartsman, and Jodi Schottenfeld-Roames.

This repository is a forked version just for me to learn.

It implements (somewhat):
- 3D network simulation
- Self Avoidance
